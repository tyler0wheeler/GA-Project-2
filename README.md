# GA-Project-2

-My idea is to create an app that allows Luthiers to post their builds and all the details of their build. Each person would be allowed to add an entry to the page that consists of the details of the instrument, a picture, and a story of inspiration as to why they built it.

-front and back image as well as two additional images (or more depends on design I want for app)
-I would prefer it be login based so people can have their own account and view their posts as well as others
-People would be able to comment on other peoples posts
-a community board where users can post questions or information to help other luthiers would be great
-I can start off the page with my own builds and then reach out to other luthiers to post some of their builds as well to add some more content
-the ability to upload sound clips
