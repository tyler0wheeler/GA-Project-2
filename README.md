## *The Luthier's Gallery*

## *Inspiration*
--------------
With this full CRUD application, I wanted to create a place where luthiers could come together and share their builds and knowledge with other luthiers.  Luthiers in general are always very open to sharing their ideas with other builders and creating a community for them to do that is exactly what I set out to do.  This is not a place for people to sell their products but a community for us to come together and showcase our hard work.  What gives me inspiration as a builder is seeing what others are doing with their work.  I love to see the creativity of others and wanted to create a place where it could all be showcased.  You could see a builder of 15 years right next to a brand new builder.  There is very little judgment in this community as we are all here to appreciate and learn from the innovation and creativity of others.

## *Features of the Site*
-----------------------
The site features a gallery of builds users can share as well as a community board where users can post anything luthiery related for other users to see.  To post in the gallery or the community board, the user is required to register for the site where the share their name, a username, and create a password.  Once they do that they are granted access to all aspects on the site.  As each user posts their builds, those builds are added to the main gallery as well as their own gallery.  Within their own gallery, they can edit or delete their build.  They do not have access to do so to any other posts aside from their own.  They are also granted access to post on the community board with their login credentials.
The pages go as follows:

* Home page
* Login
* Register
* Gallery
* Community Board
* My Gallery

The navigation bar gives the user a clear path to wherever they are looking to end up on the site.

## Languages Used
-----------------
* Javascript
* JSON
* Express
* HTML
* CSS (skeleton and normalize)

## *Problems on this journey*
-----------------------------
With any project here at GA, it always comes with its own unique set of challenges.  CSS is still a bit of struggle for me and using Skeleton and Normalize was a bit to get use to at first.  Once I started to better understand how these CSS templates were set up I started to gain some comfort and solved my problems with less guesswork.  The image sizes were hard to work with and set uniformly but considering I wasn't able to use multer I think I did an okay job. Honestly I felt pretty good about all the other aspects of this project that I was able to achieve!

## *The Furture of the Luthier*
-------------------------------
I have a list of a few things I would like to do to expand on this app in the future that I was not able to meet in the given time to complete to project.
* Gallery pages for each individual user that can be accessed in the main gallery
* Reply threads to community posts
* Use of multer for image and audio upload
Uploading audio would be great but I feel like most builders showcase their products with audio and video so the fact that I was only able to use a link to an outside page for that feature does not upset me too much.  The images on the other hand I would love more control on how they come into the site.  It would make styling A LOT easier.  

## *THANK YOU*
---------------
Always, Always, Always have to thank the staff here at GA as well as my peers here in class.  Without you all I would lose my mind trying to solve some of these problems!
